# CrucibAI – VS Code & Cursor Extension

This extension works in **both VS Code and Cursor**. Cursor is built on VS Code and uses the same extension API, so you only need to install this once—no separate "Cursor extension" required.

- **VS Code:** Install from marketplace or load this folder as a development extension.
- **Cursor:** Install the same extension; it runs in Cursor with full compatibility.

Commands: Generate Code, Quick Fix, Analyze Vibe, Voice Input, Generate Tests, Refactor, Generate Docs, Settings.
