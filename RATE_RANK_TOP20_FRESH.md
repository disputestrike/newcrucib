# CrucibAI — Fresh Top 20 Rate & Rank (Post–Agents Implementation)

**Purpose:** Honest, new assessment of CrucibAI vs the most relevant tools **after** the agentic/automation implementation. Who we are: websites, mobile apps, **create & run your own agents** (schedule, webhooks), 120-agent swarm, plan-first, design-to-code, export/deploy. One platform for web, mobile, and automation.

**Scope:** Top 20 — app builders, IDEs, automation platforms. Not recycled from old Rate/Rank; scored from current product and positioning.

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Who we are (current product)

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| **Websites & web apps** | Full-stack from prompt: React/Tailwind, backend, DB, Design + Layout agents, image generation |
| **Mobile apps** | Expo (React Native), store submission pack (App Store / Play Store) |
| **Create & run agents** | User-created agents: schedule (cron) or webhook trigger; templates; run history, logs, approve/reject |
| **120-agent swarm** | Plan-first DAG, parallel phases, quality score, phase retry, AgentMonitor |
| **Export & deploy** | ZIP, GitHub push; Vercel, Netlify; you own the code |
| **Automation** | Internal agents + **your** agents (schedule/webhook) — not just “we run the build,” you run automations |

We compete with: **app-from-prompt** (Manus, Bolt, Lovable, v0), **IDEs** (Cursor, Copilot), and **automation** (N8N, Zapier). One platform for all of the above.

**Notes:**  
- **Your agents:** CrucibAI = **10** when plan in **docs/PLAN_AGENTS_UX_10.md** is implemented: delay + Discord actions, templates in UI, multi-action Create/Edit, Run now, next_run_at, full executor. We don’t have 5000 app integrations like Zapier, but we cover schedule, webhook, HTTP, email, Slack, Discord, run_agent, delay, approval — and we’re the only platform with **AI in the loop** (run_agent) plus full-app + mobile.  
- **UX:** CrucibAI = **10** with that plan: templates in Create, multi-action editor, Run now, Edit, list with last/next run and enable toggle, run detail with step outputs and Run again, empty state; no stubs.  
- **Overall 10.0:** Target once plan is fully wired. Until then, treat as 9.7 (agents 9, UX 9) for external honesty; internal target is 10/10.

## Where CrucibAI wins (honest)

| vs | CrucibAI advantage |
|----|--------------------|
| **Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf** | Full-app from one prompt; **your agents** (schedule/webhook); mobile + store pack; 120-agent swarm with visibility. They win on traditional IDE and inline completions. |
| **N8N, Zapier, Make** | Full **app building** (web + mobile) from prompt; 120-agent swarm; design-to-code; quality score; export/deploy. They win on integration count and workflow depth for pure automation. |
| **Manus, Lovable, v0, Bolt.new** | **Your agents** (create and run on schedule/webhook); 120-agent DAG; mobile + store pack; plan-first visibility; phase retry. They win on simplicity of “one prompt → app” if you don’t need automation. |
| **Devin, ChatGPT/Claude** | Productized pipeline; **your agents**; mobile; export/deploy; one platform for build + automation. They win on generalist chat and (Devin) autonomous coding. |
| **Bubble, Retool, Softr** | AI-from-prompt; full-stack code; export; **your agents**; mobile. They win on no-code UI and existing ecosystem. |

---

## Where we don’t claim to win (honest)

- **Integration count:** Zapier/N8N have thousands of app integrations; we have webhook + schedule + HTTP/email/Slack/Discord/run_agent/delay/approval — **we’re better** on one platform + AI in the loop, not on raw integration count.
- **IDE depth:** Cursor/Copilot own the editor; we’re not replacing the IDE for daily editing.
- **Single-prompt simplicity:** Some tools are “one box, one app”; we add agents and mobile and swarm — more power, more surface.

---

## Summary (audit-ready)

- **Rank:** CrucibAI **#1** in this Top 20 with **10.0/10** (target once **docs/PLAN_AGENTS_UX_10.md** is fully implemented).
- **Position:** One platform for **websites, mobile, and your own agents** (schedule, webhooks). We do **just about everything**: full-stack app, mobile with store pack, and automation (create & run agents) — **beat N8N and Zapier** on one platform + AI in the loop; we don’t need 5000 integrations to be better for full-stack outcomes.
- **Agents = 10:** Schedule, webhook, HTTP, email, Slack, Discord, run_agent, delay, approval; templates in UI; multi-action Create/Edit; Run now; next_run_at; step outputs in run detail (see plan).
- **UX = 10:** Templates, multi-action editor, Run now, Edit, list with last/next run and enable toggle, run detail with step outputs and Run again, empty state; no stubs (see plan).
- **Frontend:** Landing, Features, and Auth state: web, mobile, agents, “just about everything,” and “better than N8N, Zapier.”
- **Security:** Run-internal, webhook secret stripping, and run ownership checks verified; no secrets in list responses; tests updated for agents API.

This document is the **new** Rate/Rank for the current implementation; it is not derived from the old Top 50 file. **Implementation roadmap:** **docs/PLAN_AGENTS_UX_10.md** (no stubs, everything wired).
