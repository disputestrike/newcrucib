# How Marketers and Marketing Agencies Use CrucibAI

**Purpose:** How marketing specialists, agencies, and anyone focused on customer acquisition and “getting in front of people” can use CrucibAI — beyond development. We are a tool for marketers who spend money to make money.

## 1. Why CrucibAI for marketing?

- **One platform for presence and automation:** Build the assets (landing pages, sites, funnels) and run the workflows (emails, social, content, lead capture) in one place.
- **Same AI in builds and in automations:** The same AI that builds your app runs inside your automations (run_agent: Content Agent, Scraping Agent, etc.). So you get consistent quality from campaigns to code.
- **No-code optional:** Describe what you want in plain language; get working pages, forms, and flows without writing code. Marketers can own the full funnel.

## 2. What marketers can do with CrucibAI

### Build marketing assets (web + mobile)

| Use case | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Landing pages** | “Build a landing page with hero, features, pricing, and waitlist form.” One prompt → live page; export or deploy. |
| **Blogs and content sites** | “Build a blog with post list and detail view.” Use for SEO, thought leadership, or content hubs. |
| **Lead capture / funnels** | “Build a page with a form that saves leads and sends a thank-you email.” Connect to your automation (webhook or run_agent). |
| **Portfolios and case studies** | “Build a portfolio site with project cards and contact form.” For agencies and freelancers. |
| **Pricing and comparison pages** | “Build a pricing page with three tiers and a CTA.” Match your positioning and copy. |
| **Mobile presence** | “Build a simple mobile app for our brand (splash, menu, contact).” We generate Expo/React Native and a store pack (App Store / Play Store). |

All of these are **real, deployable** outputs — not mockups. Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or download ZIP.

### Automate marketing workflows (agents)

| Use case | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Daily digest / reports** | Create an agent: schedule 9am → run_agent (Content Agent: “Summarize key updates for today”) → email to self or team. |
| **Lead nurturing** | Webhook on form submit → run_agent (Content Agent: “Personalized follow-up for B2B lead”) → send email or Slack. |
| **Social and content** | Schedule → run_agent (Content Agent or Scraping Agent) → post to Slack, save to sheet, or trigger another tool via HTTP. |
| **Competitor / market checks** | Schedule weekly → run_agent (Scraping Agent) → format and email or store. |

Agents use the **same 120-agent swarm** that builds your app (Content, Scraping, etc.), so quality and tone stay consistent.

### Prompt-to-automation (describe in plain language)

- **“Every morning at 9, summarize the key updates and email them to me.”**  
  We generate the agent: schedule 9am + Content Agent + email step.
- **“When someone submits the contact form, run our Content Agent to draft a reply and post it to Slack for approval.”**  
  We generate the agent: webhook trigger + run_agent + Slack.

So marketers can **describe the outcome**; we create the automation (no need to pick nodes one by one like in N8N/Zapier).

### General queries and basic tasks

- **Understanding and research:** Use Workspace chat or build prompts to summarize documents, compare options, or draft positioning.
- **Copy and creative:** “Generate headline and CTA for a SaaS landing page” or “Write three meta descriptions for SEO.” Use the same AI that powers builds and agents.
- **One-off assets:** “Build a simple one-page event registration” or “Build a thank-you page with next steps.” Quick iterations without involving devs.

## 3. Customer acquisition: getting in front of people

| Goal | How CrucibAI helps |
|------|--------------------|
| **Traffic and SEO** | Build blogs, content pages, and landing pages that you own and can optimize (meta, structure, content). Deploy and connect to analytics. |
| **Lead capture** | Build forms and funnels; send leads to your CRM or automation via webhook; use agents to follow up or qualify. |
| **Paid and campaigns** | Build landing pages and thank-you pages that match ad creative; keep messaging consistent with content generated by the same AI. |
| **Retention and engagement** | Use scheduled agents for digests, check-ins, or personalized content so the same AI that built the experience also powers the touchpoints. |

We don’t replace your ad spend or channels; we help you **own the destination** (sites, pages, forms) and **automate the follow-up** (agents, run_agent, webhooks).

### Closing the loop: push creatives to Meta / Google Ads

We produce the **copy and creatives** (Content Agent, Workspace); we don’t have a built-in “post to Meta/Google” button. You can still connect the two:

- **Manual:** Copy our generated headlines, body, and CTA into Meta Ads Manager or Google Ads.
- **Automated:** Add an **HTTP** step in your agent that POSTs to **your** endpoint (e.g. a small server or Zapier/Make) with the Content Agent output. Your endpoint holds Meta/Google API credentials and creates the ad or campaign. So “run Content Agent → HTTP to my ad-proxy → ads go live” is possible today without us storing ad-platform tokens.

See **docs/GAPS_AND_INTEGRATIONS_REVIEW.md** for options and roadmap.

## 4. Marketing agency use cases

- **Client work:** Build and iterate landing pages, microsites, and simple apps per client without maintaining a big dev team. One prompt per concept; deploy or hand off.
- **Internal tools:** Build dashboards, report generators, or simple CRUD tools for the agency (e.g. “Build a simple project status dashboard”).
- **Automation for clients:** Set up “every Monday send a summary of X” or “on form submit do Y” using agents; same platform as the sites you build.
- **Pricing:** Use **Agency** tier (or Enterprise) for higher credit volume and team use; credits apply to both builds and agent runs.

## 5. Summary

- **Marketers** use CrucibAI to **build** (landing pages, blogs, funnels, mobile presence) and **automate** (scheduled and webhook agents, often with “describe in plain language”).
- **Customer acquisition** is supported by owning deployable pages and forms and by automating follow-up and content with the same AI that builds the experience.
- **Agencies** use it for client deliverables, internal tools, and client automations — one platform for “what’s in front of people” and “what happens after they show up.”
- **We are a tool for marketing** in the sense that we help people who spend money (on ads, tools, time) to **make money** by shipping assets and workflows faster and keeping quality consistent across build and automation.

**Say it as we do:** See **docs/MESSAGING_AND_BRAND_VOICE.md** for locked lines (Monday→Friday, “You run the ads; we built the stack,” one-liner).
