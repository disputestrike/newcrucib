# Who Builds Better Products? Who Builds Faster? Which Is More Helpful for All Users?

**We need to win here.** This is the answer.

## Who builds **better** products?

**CrucibAI.**

- **Structure:** 120 agents, each with one real behavior (state, artifact, or tool). No “prompt only.” You get a plan, requirements, stack, and every step is verifiable (state + files + tool_log).
- **Quality visibility:** Built-in quality score and breakdown, phase retry, security and UX reports in state. You see what passed and what failed.
- **Audit trail:** Build state, Event timeline, workspace files. You can show “this agent wrote this file; this agent ran this check.” Better for teams and compliance.

Others: one black box (one agent does everything) or no plan/state visibility. We give you **better** because you see and verify every step.

## Who builds **faster** products?

**CrucibAI.**

- **Parallel DAG:** Many agents run in the same phase. No artificial delay between steps. We run as fast as the slowest agent in each phase, not 120 steps in a row.
- **No fake latency:** We don’t add “thinking” delays. Sandbox runs (tests, security) are real; when Docker is available, they run in isolation without blocking the rest of the pipeline.
- **Self-heal:** Bounded autonomy loop re-runs tests and security once if they failed, so you get a second chance without starting over.

Others: sequential flows or one long chain. We’re **faster** because we parallelize and avoid unnecessary waits.

## Which is **more helpful for all users**?

**CrucibAI.**

- **Plan-first:** Everyone sees the plan, requirements, and stack before code. Non-experts understand what’s being built; experts can correct it.
- **One prompt → full app:** From “build a todo app” to runnable app, deploy, and export. No need to know the stack or which agent to call.
- **Visible progress:** Event timeline, Build state, Live preview, ManusComputer. Users see “what’s running” and “what was produced.” Less confusion, more trust.
- **Works for everyone:** Free tier, templates, examples. You don’t need to be a dev to get a working app; devs get full control (workspace, state, deploy).

Others: either expert-only (IDE, raw agents) or opaque (one box, no visibility). We’re **more helpful** because we’re built for all users and we show the work.
