# CrucibAI — Inevitable AI

**State the idea. We build it.** No product limit: web apps, mobile apps (Expo + App Store / Play Store pack), SaaS, bots, agents, dashboards, landing pages. **The same AI that builds your app runs inside your automations** (schedule, webhook, run_agent). Bring your code (paste, ZIP, Git) → we stand it up, you fix, continue, or rebuild. One platform for builds and automations.

**Local app (after starting backend + frontend):**  
Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser (do not use `http://localhost` alone).  
Backend API: http://localhost:8000  

**To start:** Run **`.\run-dev.ps1`** from the repo root (PowerShell), or see **[RUN.md](RUN.md)** for two-terminal steps. Vision: **[BUILD_ANYTHING.md](BUILD_ANYTHING.md)**.

**Deploy on Railway (backend):**  
1. Connect this repo to Railway.  
2. **Add 3 variables**: `MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME`, `JWT_SECRET`.  
3. Redeploy.  
→ Full steps: **[RAILWAY_QUICKSTART.md](RAILWAY_QUICKSTART.md)**.
